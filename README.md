# Manufacturing: Predictive Maintenance
Data science helps manufacturers predict equipment failures by analyzing sensor data from machines. This enables proactive maintenance, reduces downtime, and improves overall operational efficiency.
Building and validating linear models for classification involve selecting relevant features, preprocessing data, training the model, and assessing its performance using various metrics. Regularization, feature engineering, and careful consideration of evaluation metrics contribute to the effectiveness of the model in the context of setting maintenance flags based on identified fault symptoms.
